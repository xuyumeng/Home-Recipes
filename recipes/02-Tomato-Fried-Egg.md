# Tomato with Fried Egg

Ingredients:
 - Canned tomato or tomato sauce (not ketchup!)
 - 2-3 Eggs
 - Little spring onion or onion
 - Suger

Procedures:
 1. Chop the spring onion or onion (around 1 tbsps)
 2. Preheat the oil in the pan
 3. Pan fry the onion until it gets little golden brown
 4. Put eggs into the pan, stir to mix (better to beaten them in a bowl, lazy way also works)
 5. Wait for the egg getting cooked and use the flipper to break them into pieces. Transfer the scrambled eggs to a bowl.
 6. Add the diced tomatoes or tomato sauce to the same pan. Cook until the tomatoes release their juices and some of the liquid evaporates.
 7. Put back the eggs, mix, add 1-2 tbsp (10-20g) of suger and 0.5-1 tsp (1-2g) of salt, adjusting to your taste.
 8. Continue cooking until the mixture reaches your desired consistency, with most of the excess liquid evaporated.
